What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?**\n","- A regular expression also known as regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Regular expression are used in search algorithms, search and replace dialogs of text editors and in lexical analysis. It is also uesd for input validation. It is technique that developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.\n","- Different syntaxes are used for writing regular expression. One is the POSIX standard and another, widely used is the Perl synatx.\n","- Manipulation of textual data plays important role in data science projects that require large scale text procesing. Many programming languages including python provide regex capabilities, built-in or via libraries. python staandard library has `re` module for this purpose.\n","- The most common applications of regular expression are:\n","  1. search for a pattern in a string.\n","  2. Finding a pattern string.\n","  3. Break string into a sub strings.\n","  4. Replace part of a string.\n","- **re.match(pattern, string)**\n","\n","  This function returns None if no match can be found.
