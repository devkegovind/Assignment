Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n","- By using functions, we can avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program.\n","- Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to updated. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"iiXvtXhMzGvs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**2. When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called?**\n","- This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is specified or when the function is called? The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pIIUNDn1zMGx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**3. What statement creates a function?**\n","- A function is created with the def keyword. The statements in the block of the function must be indented. The def keyword is followed by the function name with round brackets and a colon."],"metadata":{"id":"MWQZlFh5185T"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n","- A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function."],"metadata":{"id":"F8aAezd12nBs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**\n","- There's only one global python scope per program execution. "],"metadata":{"id":"Y72i8VGA3ihV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**\n","- A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called A local variable becomes undefined after the function call completes.

Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?**\n","- A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and \"returns\" the result(value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statement after the return statements are not executed. if the return is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.\n","- A python function will always have a return value. There is no notion of procedure or routine in python. So, if you don't explicitly use a return value in a return a defult value for you."],"metadata":{"id":"XngiJTXg5v8y"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n","- If a function does not have a return statement, it returns None."],"metadata":{"id":"hqd_p6ZO7dOF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?**\n","- Normally, when you create a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword."],"metadata":{"id":"8u15xB7_8gNU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**10. What is the data type of None?**\n","- The None keyword is used to define a null valu, or no value at all.

What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?**\n","- A try clause can have any number of except clauses to handle different exceptions, however, only one will be executed in case an exception occurs.
