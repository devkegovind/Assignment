To what does a relative path refer?**\n","- A relative path refers to **a location that is relative to a current directory** Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot(.) and a double-dot(..), which translate into the current directory and the the parent directory. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy."],"metadata":{"id":"TWzU4V6UWugP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**2. What does an absolute path start with your operating system?**\n","- An absolute path is a path that contains the entire path to the file or directory that you need to access. This path will begin at **the home directory of your computer** and will end with the file or directory that you wish to access."],"metadata":{"id":"WGj58uTqYJgh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**3. What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?**\n","- **os.getcwd()** method **tells us the location of current working directory(CWD).**\n","- Parameter: No parameter is required. Return Value: This method returns a string which represents the current working directory.\n","- **os.chdir()** method in python used to **change the current working directory to specific path.** It takes only a single argument as new directory path."],"metadata":{"id":"yqJ8mGbNfRIx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**4. What are the . and .. folders?**\n","- \".\" is the current directory.\n","- \"..\" is the parent directory."],"metadata":{"id":"UvcGJO5qhFWN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**5.

What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?**\n","There are three \"mode\" arguments that can be passed to the open() function:\n","- **r** : Opens the file in read-only mode. Start reading from the beginning of the file and is the default mode for `open()` function.\n","- **w** : Opens in write-only mode. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file and this will overwrite any existing file with the same name. It will create a new file if one with the same name doesn/t exist.\n","- **a** : Opens a file appending new information to it. The pointer is placed at the end of the file. A new file is created if one with the same name doesn't exist."],"metadata":{"id":"MuIkkVQjjROC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?**\n","- To open a file in write mode, \"w\" is specified. When mode \"w\" is specified, it creates empty file for output operations. \n","- If a file with the same name already exists, **its contents are discarded and the file is treated as new empty file.**"],"metadata":{"id":"MzkQHluwmHKR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?**\n","- The main difference is that **read()** will read the whole file at once and then print out the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis versus the **readline()** that will read and print out only bytes as you specify in the parenthesis. You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM.\n","- **Read()** : returns the read bytes in the form of string. Reads n bytes; if n is not specified, then reads the entire file.\n","- **Readline()** : Reads a line of the file returns in the form of a string."],"metadata":{"id":"2bMQsw_FoEKv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","**9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?**\n","- A shelf value resembles **a dictionary value**; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods that work similarly to the dictionary methods of the same names."],"metadata":{"id":"AyWanbekatlO"}}]}
